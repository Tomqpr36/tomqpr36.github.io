            <h3>My Music Page</h3>
            <p class="subtext">I created this page whilst completing the free code camp challenge about making a product landing page,
                when working on products one thing I've struggled with in the past was what topic to base it on!
                Then I realised... I really should have a web page for my music! 
                At the time of making this I was still early on my journey and only used HTML and CSS to
                create the page. However it was my first introduction to @media and responsive web Development
                and most importantly CSS Flex!

            <h3>Wrexham Building Plastics Page </h3>
            <p class="subtext">This project is a bit of a personal battle for me really. When I started learning HTML and CSS
                and I was looking for projects to take on, I looked at the website for my dad's business and realised how outdated it was!
                <a href="http://www.wrexhambuildingplastics.ukbuilders.net/index.html" target="_blank">(Click here to see the original)</a>
                So only with the resources available from the original site I decided to create my simple responsive version of a single page layout for him
                with a simple form that submits an email directly to generate leads (currently the email form is configured to email me)

            <h3>Snake Javascript Game</h3>
            <p class="subtext"> Whilst working on the frontend developer career path course on Scrimba, I completed a task to create a basic snake game with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                Alot of the methods used within the tutorial I was familar with and it helped me build my muscle memory whilst also stretching my understanding of their power. For example 
                creating the grid for the game by using a for loop to create 100 divs was extremely interesting to me. Once I completed the course I had a basic snake game working with arrow keys on a computer.
                At this point I decided to not only add more styling to the game, but to add working buttons for touch screen players.

            <h3>Disney Plus Clone</h3>
            <p class="subtext">
                I found a popular disney + clone creation video on youtube that I decided to follow to learn about React, Styled Components, Redux and Firebase. 
                I really enjoyed the different approach to the development of the site by arranging each apart of the site into Components and importing each component
                into the index file. However I started the battle of deploying the site using github pages and this lead to a lot of stress googling and trial and error and some use of my terminal.
                However the relief when it all appeared made it all worth while!

            <h3>BoredBot</h3>
            <p class="subtext">One thing I know will open a world of possiblities and will be very important with my future work is working with an API and working with JSON.
                Until I had done this project I had no first hand experience of this. But while completing the scrimba Frontend Developer pathway I created this
                BoredBot API project. Intially as part of the challenge it was only to add the activity via the API but I decided to add the other elements
                passed by the API to really build that muscle memory of not only getting data from an API using the Fetch method, but also manipulating the DOM!

            <p class="subtext"> This project was a great little project to create an event listener, playing with IF statements and also
                manipulating the DOM multiple times. This project I really feel like the DOM manipulation clicked and made me feel comfortable with
                understanding how to make HTML more dynamic using Javascript.
